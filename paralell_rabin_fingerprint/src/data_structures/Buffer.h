/**
 * Buffer.cuh
 *
 * This file contains a type definition of a rather primitive cyclic buffer that
 * is used by the fingerprinting algorithm to store that contents of the window
 * of bytes being used in the computation of the fingerprint. This is useful since
 * at any time that we update the fingerprint with a new byte, in order to compute
 * the new hash efficiently (by resulting the old one), we need to know the value of
 * the byte that will be removed from the fingerprint. Therefore, we use this data
 * structure which will return this byte that we are interested in, each time we,
 * insert a new one (given that the buffer is full; and in fact this is the only
 * case in which we care about the value of this byte, since our aim is to maintain
 * a fingerprint that represents the full buffer). An important note to be made is
 * that this code can be called both from the device and from the host. This is done
 * to provide more flexibility with unit testing and debugging.
